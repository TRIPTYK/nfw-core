# Guards

You will need to use the callGuardWithParams method to test the guard's behavior.

You can also test the guard by only calling the method's instance but you will not get the exact behavior.

```ts title="demo-http/tests/guard.test.ts"
--8<-- "sandbox/demo-http/tests/guard.test.ts"
```

```ts title="demo-http/src/guards/guard.ts"
--8<-- "sandbox/demo-http/src/guards/guard.ts"
```
