# Introduction

Testing in NFW-HTTP is aimed to be easy as possible and agnostic of the testing library.

For the demonstration, jest is the testing library for the different code examples.

!!! note
    The functions used for testing will be refined in the future. But the testing procedure stays the same.

## Understanding resolution and execution

In order to test a guard, a param, or a response handler. You need to understand the 2 steps done by the framework to translate the metadata generated by your decorators.

### 1. Resolution

First, the metadata are fetched from the MetadataStorage by the `Resolver`.
The `Resolver` then returns an `Executable` for a specific controller context.

### 2. Execution

The `Executable` is executed each time a request is made to your endpoint in a specified `RouterContext`.
